Shape clipping functionality in HarmonyOS development is used for cropping and masking components. Below is a simplified guide to its usage.

Official documentation: https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-references-V5/ts-universal-attributes-sharp-clipping-V5#mask12

1. **Clipping Functionality**
   - **`clip` Property** (Supported from API Version 7, updated in API Version 12): Determines whether to clip child components of the current component. Accepts a boolean parameter. For example, when an `Image` component is inside a `Row` component, setting `clip(true)` on the `Row` will constrain the image display within the row's border (e.g., rounded corners set via `borderRadius`).
   - **`clipShape` Property** (Supported from API Version 12): Clips the component to a specified shape (`CircleShape`, `EllipseShape`, `PathShape`, or `RectShape`). For example, to crop an image into a circle, create a `Circle` object with appropriate dimensions and apply it to the `Image` component's `clipShape` property.

2. **Masking Functionality**
   - **`mask` Property** (Supported from API Version 12): Adds a progress-based mask to the component. Accepts a `ProgressMask` parameter, which allows setting properties like progress value, maximum value, and color for dynamic effects.
   - **`maskShape` Property** (Supported from API Version 12): Applies a geometric mask (circle, ellipse, path, or rectangle) to the component. Create a shape object (e.g., `Rect`, `Circle`) with properties like fill color, then apply it to the component's `maskShape` property.

### Example Code Analysis

1. **Clipping Example**
   In the `ClipAndMaskExample` struct:
   - The `clip` property is demonstrated on a `Row` containing an `Image`. Setting `clip(true)` and `borderRadius(20)` crops the image to rounded corners. Without `clip(true)`, the image corners would extend beyond the row's rounded border.
   - The `clipShape` property uses a `Circle` shape with 280px diameter to crop the image into a perfect circle.

2. **Masking Example**
   In the `ProgressMaskExample` struct:
   - A `ProgressMask` object is applied to an `Image` via the `mask` property, creating a progress-based mask. Animation effects are configured including duration, curve, delay, iterations, and play mode.
   - Button click events control:
     - `updateProgress`: Increases the mask's progress value
     - `updateColor`: Changes the mask color
     - `enableBreathingAnimation`: Toggles the breathing glow animation when progress reaches 100%

Shape clipping provides powerful styling capabilities for components, enabling various personalized UI effects. Developers can flexibly utilize these properties and methods to optimize application interfaces based on specific requirements.
